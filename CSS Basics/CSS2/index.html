            <p class="error">Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.</p> 
            <p>Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used.</p>
            <p class="success">Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.[1] These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.</p>
            <p class="success feedback">There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.[5][6] The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.</p>
